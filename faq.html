							<h3>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h3>
							<HR>
							<div class="question">How does it work?</div>
                            <div class="answer">We come to the location and bring the balls, blow them up and then we will come back at the end to take them away, we do not normally stay during the event and then we leave you to play a game of soccer.</div>

                            <div class="question">Can we have more than x amount of people?</div>
                            <div class="answer">Yes you can have as many people as you like but we do suggest games of 4 on 4 or 5 on 5 and rotating people through because it can get quite tiring.</div>

                            <div class="question">How much does it cost?</div>
                            <div class="answer">It costs 20 dollars per hour, per ball.</div>

                            <div class="question">Does the pricing chart include tax?</div>

                            <div class="question">Do you have any suggestions on where we can play?</div>
                            <div class="answer">Yes we can help you with suggestions and suggest places people have played before.</div>

                            <div class="question">Do you find the venue for us?</div>
                            <div class="answer">Normally that is up to you, as long as there are power outlets then we are good to go but we can help you with suggestions based on places we have been before.</div>

                            <div class="question">Do you travel to x?</div>
                            <div class="answer">Yes we can travel to most places, however outside of London, standard government mileage rates apply for delivery.</div>

                            <div class="question">Do you do this for young kids?</div>
                            <div class="answer">Unfortunately we do not have kid size bubbles.</div>

                            <div class="question">Are there any requirements for the bubbles?</div>
                            <div class="answer">Yes there is a height requirement of 4'11 and an age requirement of 13/14.</div>

                            <div class="question">What size group do you recommend?</div>
                            <div class="answer">If it is a big enough space, group size does not really matter as everyone can rotate through the balls.
                            </div>

                            <div class="question">We have been asked by an indoor venue for proof of insurance and TSSA approval permits, can you provide us with those?</div>
                            <div class="answer">We have 2million insurance and after speaking with TSSA our balls are not deemed inflatables and do not need the TSSA permits so we have been told.</div>

                            <div class="question">How do you usually blow them up if people are renting them for outdoor use?</div>
                            <div class="answer">We need there to be power outlets available, if you live nearby a park we can always come to your house and blow them up there and then you can walk them over.</div>
